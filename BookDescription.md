Book Description
=====================================
Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) are an important class of statistical models that can be used to 
analyze correlated data. Such data are encountered in a variety of fields including biostatistics, 
public health, psychometrics, educational measurement, and sociology. 

This book aims to support a wide range of uses for the models by applied researchers in those and 
other fields by providingstate-of-the-art descriptions of the implementation of LMMs in R. 

To help readers to get familiar with the features of the models and the details of carrying them out 
in R, the book includes a review of the most important theoretical concepts of the models. 
The presentation connects theory, software and applications. It is built up incrementally, starting
with a summary of the concepts underlying simpler classes of linear models like the classical regression 
model, and carrying them forward to LMMs. 

A similar step-by-step approach is used to describe the R tools for LMMs. All the
classes of linear models presented in the book are illustrated using real-life data. The book also 
introduces several novel R tools for LMMs, including new class of variance-covariance structure for 
random-effects, methods for influence diagnostics and for power calculations. They are included into
an R package that should assist the readers in
applying these and other methods presented in this text.
