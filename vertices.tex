\begin{itemize}
\item Spanning Subgraphs of G.

\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ isolated vertex}} if it has a degree of zero.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ end-vertex}} if it has a degree of one.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ even vertex}} if it has a degree of an even number.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ odd vertex}} if it has a degree of an odd number.


\item A graph is said to be \textbf{emph{k-regular}} if the degree of each vertex is $k$. 
\item Every Graph has an even number of odd vertices.
\item A cubic graph is a graph where every vertex has degree three.
