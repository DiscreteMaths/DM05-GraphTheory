\item  Consider the pair of graphs below. Are these graphs isomorphic? Justify your answer.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[5.d]
Degree sequence 4,3,2,2,2
Degree sequence 4,3,3,2,2

\item[5.e]
K8 has degree sequence 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7 so every vertex has degree 7.

A graph consists of a finite set of vertices $V$ and a finite set of Edges $E$.
%---------------------------------------------%
The degree of a vertex $v_1$ denoted by $deg(v)$ is the number of edges incident with $v$.
A graph in which every vertex has the same degree r is called \textbf{\emph{r-regular}}.

\newpage

A path is an alternating sequences of vertices and edges of the form
$v_1e_1v_2e_2 \ldots e_{k-1}v_k$

The length of a path is the number of edges in it.
