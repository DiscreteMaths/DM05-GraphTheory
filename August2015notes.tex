The LME for the ith subject is written as:
 
yi=0+1xi1+2xi2+b0+b1izi1+b2izi2+i 
 
 yi is the response variable.
 
The intercept and two methods are fixed effects, with  coefficients.
The two methods are also random effects, with b coefficients.
 
%===================================================================================================%

A multilevel mode is used to describe the blood pressure yijk measured.
 
yijk=j+bi+bi,k+ijk
 
Fixed Effects 
j describes the fixed effect of the jth method.
 
Random effects
bi describes the random effect of subject i
bi,k describes the kth replicate within subject effect 
 
Error
ijk residual.
