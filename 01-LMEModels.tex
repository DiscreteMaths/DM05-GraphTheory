Two LME models are fitted to the data, one using the nlme package, one with the lme4 package. These models shall be called ``blood.nlme" and ``blood.lme4" respectively.
In both cases the method is characterized by a fixed effect, while there is a random effect for each subject.
This random effect accounts for the replicate measurements associated with each subject.
The differences between the estimate provided by the respective models are negligible, due to the simplicity of the model specification.
