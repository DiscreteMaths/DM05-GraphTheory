Normal Plot of Residuals or Random Effects from an lme Object

Description

Diagnostic plots for assessing the normality of residuals and random effects in the linear mixed-effects fit are obtained. 
The form argument gives considerable flexibility in the type of plot specification. 
A conditioning expression (on the right side of a | operator) always implies that different panels are used 
for each level of the conditioning factor, according to a Trellis display.
