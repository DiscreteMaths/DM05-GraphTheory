Normal Plot of Residuals or Random Effects from an lme Object

Description

Diagnostic plots for assessing the normality of residuals and random effects in the linear mixed-effects fit are obtained. 
The form argument gives considerable flexibility in the type of plot specification. 
A conditioning expression (on the right side of a | operator) always implies that different panels are used 
for each level of the conditioning factor, according to a Trellis display.

## Not run: 
fm1 <- lme(distance ~ age, Orthodont, random = ~ age | Subject)

qqnorm(fm1, ~ resid(., type = "p") | Sex, abline = c(0, 1))
# normal plots of random effects
qqnorm(fm1, ~ranef(.))
