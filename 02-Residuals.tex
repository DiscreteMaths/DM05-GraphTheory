		\item[residuals.lme] 
		The residuals at level $i$ are obtained by subtracting the fitted levels at that level from the response
		vector (and dividing by the estimated within-group standard error, if \texttt{type="pearson")}. The fitted
		values at level $i$ are obtained by adding together the population fitted values (based only on the
		fixed effects estimates) and the estimated contributions of the random effects to the fitted values at
		grouping levels less or equal to $i$.
