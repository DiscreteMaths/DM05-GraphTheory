\section{Planar Graphs}
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane such that there are no edge crossings.

\section{Characterization}
The planar graphs can be characterized by a theorem first proven by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1930, which states that the planar graphs are exactly those graphs G such that K_5 \not \preceq G  and K_{3,3} \not \preceq G .
